# ProstateCancerEDA

This dataset is originally called Byar and Greene Prostate Cancer Data and it is obtained from the 
website of the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics. This topic is chosen because of 
personal interest for biostatistics hoping to learn more about how data analysis can help the healthcare 
industry to improve its efficiency in saving lives and maintaining the public health of the community. 
Specifically, this dataset can potentially contribute more to cardiovascular disease knowledge and in 
what way some factors in our lives including weight, blood pressure, etc. can affect the possibility of 
getting prostate cancer or related disease.

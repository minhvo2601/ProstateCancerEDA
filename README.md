# ProstateCancerEDA

This project was for a university course STAT 3010: Computer Applications of Statistics in the Fall of 2020. 
I used SAS Studio to generate univariate and multivariate descriptive analysis models in hopes of exploring 
the correlations between the risk of contracting prostate cancer and common health factors. A final paper
was produced to report the findings as well as graphical presentations for Explanatory Data Analysis.

This dataset is originally called Byar and Greene Prostate Cancer Data and was obtained from the 
website of the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics. This topic is chosen because of 
my interest in biostatistics hoping to learn more about how data analysis can help the healthcare 
industry to improve its efficiency in saving lives and maintaining the public health of the community. 
Specifically, this dataset can potentially contribute more to cardiovascular disease knowledge and in 
what way some factors in our lives including weight, blood pressure, etc. can affect the possibility of 
getting prostate cancer or related disease.
